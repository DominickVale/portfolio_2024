intro: 'This was my first portfolio website. At the time (2019) i was learning both UI / Graphic design and development at the same time. One of the things that struck me about how UI design was taught, was the sheer amount of copy paste and boring layouts. Of course, i understood that it was a simply an UX matter, why change something that has been demonstrated to work? But at the same time i already started thinking about how to change things up and make websites more unique and memorable. I wanted my websites to be enjoyable, and make people think "wow, this is a nice website", instead of "this is a website". Mind you, at the time i had no idea of "awwwards-like", creative websites. My goal was getting a front-end development job, not UI designer, so i wanted to play it safe.'

    ## THE RESEARCH
    I spent a good amount of time researching every developer and designer portfolio i could find, on discord servers, google, github, and youtube videos reviewing and correcting portfolio submissions. Again, not many websites were unique, as a matter of fact i cannot remember a single one of those designs, but i know it included a hero background image on the right, a CTA in the center left, classical bootstrap-feeling navbar on top and lots of white space. I knew i had to play it safe, but i didn't want to give the feel of having designed my website copying a video tutorial on youtube. So i focused more on studying Graphic design. Which gave me a lot more insight on the possibilities of design, a better understanding of typography, design elements, and more. One type of design i stumbled across, was Futuristic User Interfaces (or FUI for short). I honestly never paid too much attention to them in movies, probably because they were doing their job correctly. But looking at them with a critic eye in still images or loopable videos changed things up real quick. I was hooked, i loved that style. Of course, pure FUI as designed for movies would be the dumbest idea for a website in which every second of user interaction counts, and even a fly landing on a potential employer's monitor could cost me a job opportunity. But i really wanted my digital identity to feature that 'techy', 'futuristic' feel i loved so much. So i tried my best to figure out how to make a usable FUI design for the web that would still respect most UX practices.
