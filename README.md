# TODOs

- Fix menus not changing between pages (e.g to blog page)
- fix codecs audios firefox
- Optimize imports (no import \* from ...) (also split js into as many independent chunks as possible)
- Figure out some hacks for font rendering
- Add more post-processing (blur/aberration on transitions based on position speed etc.)
- Make clicky things squishy

# REMINDERS

- Sounds should mainly be comprised of lower frequencies, try to make them only audible to headphone users
